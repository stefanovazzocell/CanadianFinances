# Taxes

Filling your taxes may sound daunting, but I've discovered that it can actually be quite exciting. I personally use [Wealthsimple Tax](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/tax) (formerly Simpletax - RIP), and it not only comes at no cost but is also remarkably user-friendly.

For employed individuals, filing taxes often results in a tax refund. Even if you're a student, filing your taxes is crucial to accumulating [tuition credits](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/education-deductions.html). So, don't delay â€“ file your taxes!

Consider using [Wealthsimple Tax](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/tax) for a hassle-free and cost-free tax filing experience. I recommend steering clear of TurboTax, as not only do they charge for a service that in my opinion should be free, but they have also been known to lobby against free tax software in the US.

## Tax Credits

When filing your taxes, you may be eligible for various tax credits, including:

- [Basic Personal Amount (BPA)](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/federal-government-budgets/basic-personal-amount.html): This non-refundable tax credit allows all Canadian taxpayers to claim a specific amount of income tax-free, offered by both federal and provincial governments.
- [Medical Expenses](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/rc4065/medical-expenses.html): You can claim a tax credit for eligible medical expenses paid for yourself, your spouse or common-law partner, and certain dependents.
- [Charitable Donations Tax Credit](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-34900-donations-gifts.html): Receive a credit for eligible charitable donations made during the tax year.
- [Work-from-home expenses](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-22900-other-employment-expenses/work-space-home-expenses/how-claim.html#h-2): If you work from home and incurred non-refunded expenses, you may be eligible for this tax credit.

Additionally, you might qualify for monthly or quarterly benefits, such as:

- [Canada Child Benefit (CCB)](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/canada-child-benefit-overview.html): A tax-free monthly payment for eligible families with children under 18, dependent on factors like family income and the number of children.
- [GST/HST credit](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/goods-services-tax-harmonized-sales-tax-gst-hst-credit.html): A tax-free quarterly payment designed to offset the cost of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) or the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) for low and modest-income individuals and families.

## Tax loss harvesting

Tax loss harvesting is a strategy that you can use in non-registered accounts to minimize your tax liability by intentionally selling investments that have been under-performing. Capital losses can be used to offset capital gains, and any excess losses can be carried forward to future years. However, it's crucial to note that tax loss harvesting is generally applicable only to non-registered accounts, as registered accounts like RRSPs and TFSAs have different tax treatment, and losses within these accounts cannot be used to offset gains. Additionally, the "superficial loss" rule must be considered, and investors are advised to maintain accurate records and seek guidance from tax professionals or financial advisors to ensure compliance with current regulations and alignment with financial goals.
