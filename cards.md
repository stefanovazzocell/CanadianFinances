## Credit Cards

Credit cards can be a bit of a double-edged sword. I won't discuss here if you should get one or not, but I personally decided to have one. In this section, I will discuss the best cash-back credit cards in Canada.

I prefer cash-back credit cards because they don't require navigating through arbitrary points systems to get rewards, and generally, they offer better benefits for my lifestyle.

### Tangerine Credit Card

If you have a lower income, consider their [Money-Back Credit Card](https://www.tangerine.ca/en/products/spending/creditcard/money-back). Alternatively, if you're eligible, go for the [World Mastercard](https://www.tangerine.ca/en/products/spending/creditcard/world) for some extra benefits.

#### Facts Sheet

- No fee
- **2%** on 2-3 categories of your choice, 0.5% on everything else.
- No limits on the rewards
- Mastercard

### American Express

They offer both a no-fee [Simply Cash](https://www.americanexpress.com/en-ca/credit-cards/simply-cash/) card and, for $9.99/month, a [Simply Cash Preferred](https://www.americanexpress.com/en-ca/credit-cards/simply-cash-preferred/) card.

#### Facts Sheet - Simply Cash

- No fee
- **2%** on *Groceries* and *Gas* (up to $300 annually), **1.25%** on everything else.
- No limits on the rewards

#### Facts Sheet - Simply Cash Preferred

- $9.99 monthly fee
- **4%** on *Groceries* and *Gas* (up to $1.2k annually), **2%** on everything else
- No limits on the rewards

If your grocery store or gas pump supports Amex, this is worth it if you spend more than $6000/year on those categories.

## Debit Cards

All the following cards are **no-fee** debit (pre-paid if you'd like) cards. They don't affect your credit score and directly deduct money from your bank account, making it a bit harder to overspend compared to a credit card.

Both of these cards don't charge **FX** (foreign transaction) fees if you travel abroad or buy from an overseas website in a currency other than CAD.

Both work on the **Mastercard** network.

### [Wealth Simple Card](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/spend)

1% cashback (with some exceptions).

### [EQBank Card](https://www.eqbank.ca/personal-banking/payments/card)

0.5% cashback on your spending.

With some limitations, they offer free ATM withdrawals in Canada (and will refund you the ATM fee too!).
