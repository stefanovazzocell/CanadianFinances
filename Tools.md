# Tools

Here are some tools I personally find useful.

## Canadian Retirement Income Calculator

The CRA offers an official [retirement income calculator](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/publicpensions/cpp/retirement-income-calculator.html). It's a useful tool to estimate and simulate your retirement income and update your goals accordingly.

This is an official tool so it's probably decently accurate.

## Salary Taxes Estimation

[Money Genie](https://salary.stefanovazzoler.com/) is a personal project of mine which I use to get a rough estimate of the taxes I will pay on my salary and get a picture of the take-home pay over the year.

All calculations are done in your browser (I don't collect any data) and allow you to quickly simulate your taxes in other provinces.
