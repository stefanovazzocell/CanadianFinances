# Saving and Investing for Financial Success in Canada

Saving money and building wealth in Canada requires a strategic approach. The first step is to pay off any high-interest debts, especially credit cards, to avoid wasting money on interest. Once you've cleared these debts, you can optimize your savings through registered accounts like Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSA) and Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSP). These accounts offer tax benefits and help you achieve long-term financial stability and growth.

## Strategic Allocation of Funds

To get the best returns in the long run, it's important to allocate your money wisely. This priority list is not comprehensive, and you should customize your financial strategy to your specific situation and goals. Always do your research before making any financial decisions.

### ‚≠ê Priority List

Consider following or adapting this list to aid you in decisions around what to do when you have extra cash.

1. **Employer [RRSP](./RRSP.md) Matching Program:** If your employer offers an RRSP matching program, make sure you contribute enough to get the full match. This is a great way to boost your savings with free money from your employer.

2. **High-Interest Debt Repayment:** Pay off any high-interest debts, such as credit cards, as soon as possible. This will reduce your financial stress and improve your credit score.

3. **Emergency Savings:** Build a financial cushion by creating an emergency fund in a [high-interest savings account](./HISA.md). Aim for a balance that covers at least three months' worth of essential expenses, or more depending on your risk tolerance and lifestyle.

4. **[RESP](./RESP.md) Grant (for those with children):** Maximize your child's RESP grant room to take advantage of government contributions, which guarantee a 20% return on your investment up to $500 per year per child.

5. **[FHSA](./FHSA.md) (for those who don't own a home):** Consider opening a First Home Savings Account (FHSA), a new registered savings plan introduced by the federal government in 2022. This combines the best benefits of a TFSA and a RRSP by allowing you to grow money tax free and makes your contribution tax-deductible.

6. **[TFSA](./TFSA.md):** Use your Tax-Free Savings Account for flexible, tax-free growth on your investments. You can withdraw money from your TFSA at any time without paying taxes or penalties, making it ideal for short-term or medium-term goals.

7. **[RRSP](./RRSP.md):** Contribute to your Registered Retirement Savings Plan for tax-deferred growth and tax deductions on your contributions. You can also use your RRSP for the Home Buyers' Plan (HBP) or the Lifelong Learning Plan (LLP), which allow you to withdraw money from your RRSP for specific purposes without paying taxes.

8. **[RESP](./RESP.md) (if you have children):** After maximizing the RESP grant, continue to contribute to your child's RESP until you reach the lifetime limit. This will help you save more for your child's education and benefit from tax-free compounding.

### Reasoning

You might have questions and even disagree with the list above; it's in fact possible that the list is not for you, but I wanted to provide some reasoning on why it is prioritize as it is:

1. **Employer RRSP Matching and Credit Card Debt:** The decision between these two can vary based on individual circumstances. While high-interest debt repayment is typically a priority due to the potential 20% or more loss on interest, a strong employer RRSP matching program could outweigh the immediate benefits of debt repayment. It's crucial to assess the specific terms and amounts involved to determine the most financially prudent course.

2. **High-Interest Debt Repayment:** This holds a high priority as it often incurs significant interest rates, leading to potential losses of around 20%. Even in cases where employer RRSP matching is available, addressing high-interest debt promptly remains essential for overall financial well-being.

3. **Emergency Savings:** Placing emergency savings ahead of certain investments, like a TFSA, is a precautionary measure. While a TFSA allows tax-free growth, relying on it during emergencies might force the sale of investments at a loss, impacting long-term contribution room. Maintaining a dedicated emergency fund in a high-interest savings account provides a financial buffer without jeopardizing investment positions.

4. **RESP Grant (for those with children):** The government's 20% grant on RESP contributions makes it a compelling investment choice. Prioritizing this ensures the maximization of available grant room, offering a guaranteed return that surpasses many other investment options.

5. **FHSA (for those who don't own a home):** The FHSA offers a combination of the benefits of a TFSA and a RRSP, therefore it's a potentially more powerful tool in your savings arsenal

6. **TFSA:** While similar in value to an RRSP, a TFSA offers greater flexibility. Placing it ahead of RRSP in priority allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals, making it suitable for short-term or medium-term goals without the constraints associated with RRSP withdrawals.

7. **RRSP:** Contributing to a Registered Retirement Savings Plan provides tax-deferred growth and deductions on contributions. It can also serve specific purposes like the Home Buyers' Plan or the Lifelong Learning Plan. However, its lower position in priority reflects the more rigid withdrawal conditions compared to a TFSA.

8. **RESP (if you have children):** Continuing to contribute to a child's RESP after maximizing the grant ensures long-term education savings and takes advantage of tax-free compounding. This step follows the maximization of grant room and is aligned with the goal of securing a stable financial future for the family.

## What to invest in

The investment decision is yours to make. Personally, I choose to invest in ETFs, particularly those offered by Vanguard due to their low fees. If you're unfamiliar with ETFs, their workings, or if you prefer not to handle investment management yourself, financial institutions like Wealthsimple provide well-managed accounts.

### What are ETF?

Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are investment funds traded on stock exchanges that combine aspects of mutual funds and individual stocks. They offer diversification by holding a portfolio of assets, making them a popular choice for investors seeking exposure to various sectors. ETFs are favored over individual stocks due to the reduced risk associated with diversification, lower costs, and the convenience of gaining exposure to multiple assets without extensive market knowledge. Additionally, compared to managed investment accounts, ETFs often have lower fees, greater liquidity, and provide transparency regarding their holdings. Overall, ETFs provide a cost-effective, flexible, and transparent investment option for those looking to build a diversified portfolio in the Canadian financial market.
