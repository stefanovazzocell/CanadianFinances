If you've landed here, you're likely exploring options for opening a registered account. Choosing the right bank is a personal decision that requires some research. Here are my preferred choices based on my personal experience:

In my opinion, Wealthsimple provides a well-managed investing solution, including a robust self-directed option. As your wealth grows, you unlock various benefits. Their user-friendly app and effective support options have contributed to a positive experience for me.

## [Questrade](https://www.questrade.com/)

While I haven't personally used Questrade, I've heard positive reviews about their services. Notably, they support [Norbert’s Gambit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6Q1dzK8vts), a method for fee-free exchange between CAD/USD — an option not offered by Wealthsimple, as far as I know.
