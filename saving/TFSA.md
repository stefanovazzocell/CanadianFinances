# Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA)

A Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is a way for individuals who are 18 years or older and have a valid Social Insurance Number (SIN) to set money aside, tax-free, throughout their lifetime. Contributions to a TFSA are not deductible for income tax purposes. Any amount contributed as well as any income earned in the account (for example, investment income and capital gains) is generally tax-free, even when it is withdrawn.

## Eligibility

To be eligible for a TFSA, you must meet the following criteria:
- Be a Canadian resident
- Have reached the age of majority in your province or territory of residence
- Have a valid Social Insurance Number (SIN)

## Benefits

Here are some key benefits of a TFSA:
- Tax-free growth: Any investment income earned in a TFSA is tax-free, even when it is withdrawn.
- Flexibility: You can withdraw funds from your TFSA at any time, for any reason, without paying tax on the withdrawal.
- Carry forward unused contribution room: If you do not use all of your TFSA contribution room in a given year, the unused amount can be carried forward to future years.
