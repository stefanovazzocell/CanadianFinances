# Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP)

An RRSP is a way for individuals to save money for retirement purposes. Contributions to an RRSP are tax-deductible, meaning that they can be used to reduce your taxable income. Any income earned in the RRSP is usually exempt from tax as long as the funds remain in the plan. You generally have to pay tax when you receive payments from the plan; in other words, the RRSP is tax-deferred as you skip on paying taxes today and instead you pay them when you're retired and will likely be in a lower tax bracket.

## Eligibility

To be eligible for an RRSP, you must meet the following criteria:
- Be a Canadian resident
- Have earned income
- Have a valid Social Insurance Number (SIN)

## Benefits

Here are some key benefits of an RRSP:
- Tax-deductible contributions: Contributions to an RRSP are tax-deductible, meaning that they can be used to reduce your taxable income.
- Tax-free growth: Any investment income earned in an RRSP is tax-free, even when it is withdrawn.
- Carry forward unused contribution room: If you do not use all of your RRSP contribution room in a given year, the unused amount can be carried forward to future years.
