# Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP)

An RESP is a way for individuals to save money for a child's education after high school. Contributions to an RESP are not tax-deductible, but any income earned in the RESP is usually exempt from tax as long as the funds remain in the plan. The Canada Revenue Agency registers the education savings plan contract as an RESP, and lifetime limits are set by the Income Tax Act on the amount that can be contributed for each beneficiary. 

## Eligibility

To be eligible for an RESP, you must meet the following criteria:
- Be a Canadian resident
- Have a valid Social Insurance Number (SIN)

## Benefits

Here are some key benefits of an RESP:
- Tax-free growth: Any investment income earned in an RESP is tax-free, even when it is withdrawn.
- No age limit: There is no age limit for contributing to an RESP.
- Carry forward unused contribution room: If you do not use all of your RESP contribution room in a given year, the unused amount can be carried forward to future years.
- Government grants: The Canadian government offers two types of grants to help you save for a child's education: the Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG) and the Canada Learning Bond (CLB).
