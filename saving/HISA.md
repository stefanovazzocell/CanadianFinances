# High-Interest Savings Accounts

Explore some of the top high-interest savings accounts available in Canada that I personally find beneficial:

- **[Wealthsimple Cash](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/spend):** Offers an interest rate ranging from 4% to 5%, depending on your account balance and whether you opt for direct deposit of your pay.

- **[EQBank](https://www.eqbank.ca/):** Features a 4% interest rate (comprising a 2.50% regular rate and an additional 1.50% if you choose direct deposit for your pay).

In my view, these accounts are excellent for keeping your funds secure, providing the same convenience as chequing accounts from other banks, yet delivering superior rates compared to most other savings accounts.
